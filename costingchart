Assumptions:
stats MB starts out high at 1 gold, and drops bc of inherent card value.  At about 6 it balloons back up bc of removal, reaching the same high MB at 9.
ideal distribution starts out at high atk/low hp because of trading up.  At 4-5, health becomes favored bc of AOE and removal dmg.
AOE starts out very costly compared to targeted, but climbs back up in power bc it kills more bigger targets.
Typed is better for cheap cards bc of the 2-for-1ing bigger creatures, but straight is better in higher numbers.
Direct damage is at a premium early on for removing minions because of damage addition and dealing with threats.  At higher values it overkills many creatures.
